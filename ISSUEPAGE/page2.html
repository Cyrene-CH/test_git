                Every patient has a story that goes beyond the symptoms they bring into the doctor’s office.
            </p>

            <p>
                Those stories can illuminate how a person became ill, the tipping point that compelled them to seek
                help, and, perhaps most importantly, the social challenges they face in getting better. Stories can
                offer the kind of contextual richness that promotes and nourishes empathy, prompting a provider to
                switch from asking “How can I treat this disease?” to “How can I help my patient?” The difference may
                seem subtle at first, but knowing how to get patients to share their stories can be transformative in
                improving patient care, say proponents of this approach called “narrative medicine.”
            </p>

            <p>
                “[Narrative medicine] is a commitment to understanding patients’ lives, caring for the caregivers, and
                giving voice to the suffering.”

                “Narrative medicine can help us deliver more humanistic health care,” said Voruganti, who went on to
                create and teach an Art and the Medical Narrative elective course for first- and second-year medical
                students at Brown in 2015.
            </p>


            <p>

                Rita Charon, MD, PhD, executive director of Columbia’s Program in Narrative Medicine, is widely
                recognized as the originator of the field. “The effective practice of medicine requires narrative
                competence, that is, the ability to acknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and plights
                of others,” Charon wrote in a 2001 article in JAMA.“It’s not a stretch to say we need help to look at
                our own processes or to see and appreciate what patients are telling us. For me, it became a way for
                patients to feel heard and noticed,” Charon said of her early experiences integrating narrative skills
                into her clinical practice. “It’s a commitment to understanding patients’ lives, caring for the
                caregivers, and giving voice to the suffering.”

            </p>

            <p>A core component of narrative medicine education is “close reading,” or learning how to thoughtfully and
                critically analyze a text. This approach helps students develop empathetic listening skills to better
                understand and connect with patients. Today, all Columbia medical students are exposed to narrative
                medicine in their first years, when they’re required to take one of 14 seminars on topics ranging from
                memoir writing to visual arts to medical journalism. The medical school also offers a fourth-year
                elective for medical students, as well as a scholarly track in Narrative and Social Medicine that Charon
                also directs.

                While Columbia University is the only school with a graduate degree in narrative medicine, many medical
                schools have followed its lead, offering a variety of courses and seminars.

                At the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) School of Medicine, medical students can take narrative medicine
                as a scholarly concentration or as a fourth-year elective. Assignments include 10,000 words of
                reflective writing on clinical encounters that students must submit to a medical humanities publication.
                Susan Palwick, PhD, who teaches narrative medicine at UNR, said most students are drawn to write
                personal essays, though many try their hand at fiction and poetry as well.

                That’s an excerpt from “How to Tell a Mother Her Child Is Dead,” which was published last September in
                the New York Times in the Sunday Review Opinion section. Authored by Naomi Rosenberg, MD, a physician at
                Temple University Hospital, the piece is a heart-wrenching example of how narrative medicine can serve
                as an outlet for coping with the harrowing experiences that providers regularly encounter.

                Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael Vitez encouraged Rosenberg to submit the piece in his new role
                as director of narrative medicine at Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine. After retiring
                from a 30-year career as a reporter at the Philadelphia Inquirer, Vitez approached the school’s dean
                about using his skills to help students, faculty, and patients translate their experiences into words.
                The idea morphed into Temple’s new Narrative Medicine Program, which launched in 2016.
